The primary objectives of the Password Security Automation Tool are multifaceted:
   A. Promote Secure Password Practices: The tool aims to foster secure password practices among users. 
   By providing a password strength checker and a strong password generator, 
   it educates users about the characteristics of secure passwords and encourages the use of strong, unique passwords.
   B. Enhance Digital Security Awareness: In addition to its practical functionalities, the tool serves as an educational platform.
   It not only checks and generates passwords but also informs and guides users in understanding the principles of password security.
   It seeks to raise digital security awareness, enabling users to make more informed decisions about their online security.
   C. Automate Password-Related Tasks: To mitigate the risk of weak or easily guessable passwords, the tool automates the process of
   generating strong and complex passwords. This automation streamlines password management, reducing the burden on users and increasing
   the likelihood of using secure passwords.
